# My Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository hosts various projects I have worked on, and the website showcases them in an organized manner.

## Website Overview

The website is built to display different types of projects including web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Each project has its own dedicated page with a detailed description, code snippets, and visualizations.


I built this website using the following steps:

1. **Design and Develop Locally**:
   - Used an HTML5 pretemplate file as the starting point.
   - Modified the pretemplate to meet the specific needs of my projects.
   - Created the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the main website and each project page.
   - Structured the project directories to keep assets organized.

2. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Logged into GitHub and created a new repository named `my-website`.
   - Initialized the repository with a README file.

3. **Upload Website Files**:
   - Uploaded all website files (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) directly through the GitHub web interface.
   - Alternatively, you can clone the repository to your local machine, add the files, and push the changes.

4. **Set Up GitHub Pages**:
   - Went to the repository settings.
   - Scrolled down to the **`Pages`** section.
   - Under **`Source`**, selected the branch to use for GitHub Pages (usually `main` or `master`).
   - Chose the root directory for the files.
   - Saved the settings to enable GitHub Pages.

5. **Access the Website**:
   - The website is available at: `https://your-username.github.io/my-website/`.
