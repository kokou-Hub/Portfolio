					<h3>Changing Consumption Patterns</h3>
					<p>
						Food consumption fluctuated significantly across different time periods. The Pre-Pandemic period saw stable 
						consumption trends, whereas the Pandemic Onset resulted in drastic shifts in demand for certain food categories.
						The Post-Pandemic period shows a return to normalcy with lasting changes in consumer behavior.
					</p>

					<h3>Top-Consumed Food Categories</h3>
					<p>
						The data reveals that Bakery Products and Mineral Waters/Soft Drinks had the highest consumption rates across all 
						periods. This indicates a growing preference for **staple food items and convenience-based drinks.
					</p>

					<h3>Seasonal and Pandemic-Based Variations</h3>
					<p>
						Consumption patterns varied significantly throughout the pandemic. Stockpiling behavior was observed in the early pandemic months, 
						leading to spikes in food purchases. As restrictions eased, consumption trends shifted again, indicating a gradual return to normal consumer habits.
					</p>

					<h3>Impact on Different Food Sub-Categories</h3>
					<p>
						Certain sub-categories saw unexpected growth, such as processed fruits and vegetables, while others like fresh dairy and meats faced 
						fluctuations due to supply chain disruptions.
					</p>

					<h3>2. Key Takeaways and Insights</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>High Demand for Staple Foods:</strong> Bakery products and cereals were among the most consumed food categories during the pandemic.</li>
						<li><strong>Increased Demand for Packaged Goods:</strong> Consumers favored **long-shelf-life products** such as canned goods and processed items.</li>
						<li><strong>Post-Pandemic Adjustments:</strong> Some consumption habits persisted, with steady demand for **plant-based and alternative food products**.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Actionable Recommendations</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Monitor Future Consumption Trends:</strong> Businesses should continue tracking demand fluctuations to optimize supply chains.</li>
						<li><strong>Strengthen Distribution Networks:</strong> Ensuring a robust supply chain is crucial for adapting to changing consumer demands.</li>
						<li><strong>Adapt Marketing Strategies:</strong> Highlight **health-conscious and sustainable food choices**, as consumers are increasingly prioritizing these options.</li>
					</ul>
